# (yet another) UNSUPPORTED Android SMS forwarder app
This app is no longer maintained. Originally written for 4.4. No idea whether still works on recent Android versions.  
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK  


This one ~~has a killer feature~~ supports optional filtering by sender: filter can be configured either as a blacklist (to forward messages from senders not in list) or as a whitelist (to forward messages only from specified senders).  
Usage and configuration should be straightforward enough. Please note the app requires some configuration (at least a phone number to forward to).  
  
Uses an icon from [Blue Bits pack by IcoJam](http://www.icojam.com/blog/?p=253).
