# (yet another) Android SMS forwarder app
This one ~~has a killer feature~~ supports optional filtering by sender: filter can be configured either as a blacklist (to forward messages from senders not in list) or as a whitelist (to forward messages only from specified senders).  
Usage and configuration should be straightforward enough. Please note the app requires some configuration (at least a phone number to forward to).  
  
Uses an icon from [Blue Bits pack by IcoJam](http://www.icojam.com/blog/?p=253).
